## üìÅ Features

- Input fields for Start Point and End Point.  
- Design uses only the first three characters of the start and end points.  
- Functionality:
    1. If it‚Äôs a continued trip (e.g., Bangalore to Chennai, Chennai to Ooty), then the straight line is on **Level 1**.  
    2. If it‚Äôs not a continued trip (e.g., Bangalore to Chennai, Ooty to Bangalore), then the straight line should have an arrow and be on **Level 1**.  
    3. If consecutive trips have the same pickup and drop location, then those should be shown on **Level 2**.
